## Architectural Issues Identified

### 🚨 Major Issue: DOM Boundary Violations

**Problem**: Multiple non-UI modules directly access the DOM, violating separation of concerns.

**Affected Modules:**
- **Dialog Module**: 4 direct DOM operations (getElementById, createElement, addEventListener)
- **Combat Module**: 13 direct DOM operations (getElementById, createElement, appendChild)  
- **UI Module**: 85 DOM operations (appropriate - handles all interface management)

**Examples of Violations:**
```javascript
// combat.js - Should delegate to UI
const playerFish = document.getElementById('player-fish-combat');
const bubble = document.createElement('div');
document.getElementById('game-container').appendChild(bubble);

// dialog.js - Should delegate to UI
this.dialogueContainer = document.getElementById('dialogue-container');
```

**Impact**: 
- Tight coupling between business logic and presentation
- Reduced testability (modules depend on DOM existence)
- Violation of single responsibility principle

**Recommendation**: The DOM boundary violations represent a design choice where business logic modules handle their own visual effects rather than pure separation. While functional, this creates tight coupling between logic and presentation that reduces testability.

### ⚠️ Minor Issue: Module Size Imbalance

**Problem**: UI module is disproportionately large compared to others.

**Evidence**: 
- UI module: 1,732 lines (40% of codebase)
- Other modules: 87-665 lines each
- Total codebase: 4,326 lines across 9 modules

**Impact**: 
- Reduced maintainability
- Potential violation of single responsibility at module level

**Recommendation**: Consider subdividing UI module into specialized UI modules (CharacterCreationUI, CombatUI, WorldUI, etc.).
