## Development Guidelines

- Do not start the server yourself unless I say to. Your interactive tests don't work well.
- When my prompt is a question you shouldn't automatically go and make the implied change. Sometimes I want to just discuss. Also, don't take my saying something as disagreeing or asserting I'm right, I may just be asking, have missed something, or be wrong.
