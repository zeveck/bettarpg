- Sophisticated world map rendering
- Complex dialogue tree handling

⚠️ **Architectural Concerns**:
- **Size Imbalance**: Single module handling 8+ major interface areas
- **Mixed Abstraction**: Both high-level screens and low-level DOM operations
- **Responsibility Overload**: Essentially the entire game's presentation layer

**Assessment**: Functionally excellent but architecturally monolithic. Should be subdivided into specialized UI modules.

### 9. Core Module (core.js) - Grade: A+

**Perfect Coordination Layer:**

- **Dependency Injection**: Clean module initialization in correct order
- **Public API**: Proper HTML interaction interface (28 methods)
- **Circular Reference Handling**: Combat-World circular dependency resolved cleanly
- **No Implementation Logic**: Pure coordination without business logic mixing

**Architecture Pattern**:
```javascript
constructor() {
    // Correct dependency order
    this.player = new Player();
    this.audio = new AudioManager();
    this.npcs = new NPCManager();
    this.combat = new CombatManager(this.player, this.audio);
    this.world = new WorldManager(this.player, this.audio, this.combat, this.npcs);
    this.combat.setWorldManager(this.world); // Resolve circular dependency
    this.ui = new UIManager(this.player, this.audio, this.combat, this.world);
}
```

**Assessment**: Textbook coordination layer design with no improvement opportunities.

## Build System Analysis

### Build Process (build.mjs) - Grade: A+

**Simple and Effective Concatenation System:**

```javascript
const modules = [
    'src/config.js',    // Foundation
    'src/audio.js',     // Independent
    'src/player.js',    // Uses Config
    'src/npc.js',       // Uses Config
    'src/dialog.js',    // Uses Audio + Config
    'src/combat.js',    // Uses Player + Audio + Config
    'src/world.js',     // Uses all above
    'src/ui.js',        // Uses all above
    'src/core.js'       // Coordinates all
];
```

**Technical Excellence**:
- Modules concatenated in correct dependency order
- ES6 exports stripped for browser compatibility
- Zero runtime dependencies maintained
- Global game object initialization handled properly

**Assessment**: Perfect approach for zero-dependency browser compatibility while maintaining modern development patterns.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 🚨 Major Issue: DOM Boundary Violations

**Problem**: Business logic modules directly manipulate DOM, violating clean architecture principles.

**Affected Modules**:
- **Dialog Module**: 4 direct DOM operations
- **Combat Module**: 17+ direct DOM operations

**Examples**:
```javascript
// dialog.js:25 - Should be in UI module
this.dialogueContainer = document.getElementById('dialogue-container');

// combat.js:136 - Should delegate to UI
const playerFish = document.getElementById('player-fish-combat');
playerFish.style.transform = 'none';

// combat.js:518 - Should delegate to UI
const bubble = document.createElement('div');
document.getElementById('game-container').appendChild(bubble);
```

**Impact**:
- Tight coupling between business logic and presentation
- Reduced testability (modules require DOM to function)
- Violation of single responsibility principle
- Makes modules harder to unit test in isolation

### ⚠️ Significant Issue: Partial Keyboard Shortcut Registration System

**Problem**: UI module contains a sophisticated keyboard shortcut registration system that is only partially implemented.

**Found Implementation** (ui.js:88-136):
```javascript
// Keyboard shortcut registration system
this.registeredShortcuts = new Map();

registerShortcut(key, handler) {
    this.registeredShortcuts.set(key.toLowerCase(), handler);
}

clearShortcuts() {
    this.registeredShortcuts.clear();
}

registerCombatShortcuts() {
    this.clearShortcuts();
    this.registerShortcut('a', () => this.attack());
    this.registerShortcut('s', () => this.swimAway());
    // ... more shortcuts
}
```

**Current State**:
- Registration system exists and is partially functional
- Only implemented for combat shortcuts
- Village, world map, and dialogue shortcuts still use ad-hoc event handling
- Inconsistent pattern across the codebase

**Opportunity**: Complete implementation would provide unified keyboard handling across all game screens.

### ⚠️ Architectural Issue: UI Module Size Imbalance

**Problem**: UI module is disproportionately large, handling too many responsibilities.

**Evidence**:
- UI Module: 1,859 lines (41% of codebase)
- All other modules: 80-692 lines each
- Handles 8+ distinct interface areas

**Impact**:  
- Reduced maintainability
- Violates single responsibility at module level
- Makes UI changes more complex than necessary
- Creates bottleneck for interface development
