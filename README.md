# Betta Fish RPG v0.4.9

A browser-based RPG where you play as a young betta fish exploring rice paddies and battling increasingly dangerous foes.

## Overview

**Betta Fish RPG** is a turn-based RPG set in interconnected rice paddies. Create your betta, explore Paddy Village, and battle hostile fish as you venture into increasingly dangerous waters.

## Features

- **Authentic Setting**: Rice paddies, not generic fantasy - bettas' natural habitat
- **Progressive Challenge**: Visual danger zones guide you from safe village to deadly edge zones
- **Complete Keyboard Controls**: Full game playable without mouse
- **Balanced Progression**: Attack and magic improve on alternating levels
- **Epic Boss Battle**: Face the legendary Gargantuan Gar in the depths
- **Submarine Transformation**: Become an ancient Dunkleosteus for ultimate power

## How to Play

**Combat**: Turn-based battles with attacks, magic spells, and swift escapes. Enemy difficulty scales with distance from the village center.

**Progression**: Level up to unlock armor upgrades and new abilities. Save Betta Bites for the ultimate submarine transformation.

**Exploration**: Navigate rice paddies with arrow keys. Visual water tones indicate danger levels - venture to the dark edges for the ultimate challenge.

## Village Life

Meet the villagers who will guide your adventure: learn the mystery from Elder Finn, gear up at Coral's shop, rest at the Swishy Solace Inn, and discover secrets from the other inhabitants of Paddy Village.

## Dangers of the Deep

Face increasingly dangerous fish as you venture further from safety: from aggressive guppies near the village to fierce cichlids in the outer zones. The legendary Gargantuan Gar awaits those brave enough to reach the deepest waters.

## Technical Notes

Browser-based game with no installation required. Uses vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with procedural audio generation. Features a modular ES6 architecture with centralized configuration management for easy balance tweaking and localization support. All graphics are pixel art with CSS color filters for variety.
